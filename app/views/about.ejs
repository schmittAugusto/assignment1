        <p><strong>Augusto Schmitt</strong></p>
        <p>I am a 29 year old Brazilian software engineering student, living in Toronto, Canada.</p>
        <p>I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Communication and Media theory, and experience working as a marketing consultant. My career shift enabled me to have a particular outlook of software engineering through a business perspective that puts focus in marketing goals and how humans interface with technology.</p>
        <p>My main interests in software engineering are Databases, backend development and thinking of how to implement logic to find creative solutions to different problems.</p>
